## 🔧 Technical Details

### Mock Data (Development Mode)

When API is unavailable, system uses `generateMockOrders(25)`:

- 25 random orders
- Random statuses (pending, ready, completed)
- Random delivery methods (collection, delivery)
- Random timestamps (past 7 days)
- 1-3 items per order

### API Integration (Production Mode)

System tries API first, falls back to mock data:

```javascript
async function loadOrders() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("/api/admin/orders", {
      headers: {
        Authorization: "Bearer " + sessionStorage.getItem("adminToken"),
      },
    });

    if (response.ok) {
      // Use API data
    }
  } catch {
    // Fallback to mock data
  }
}
```

### Admin Authentication

All API endpoints check for admin token:

```javascript
const authHeader = context.request.headers.get('Authorization');
if (!authHeader || !authHeader.startsWith('Bearer ')) {
    return 401 Unauthorized;
}
```

### Database Queries

Orders joined with items for complete data:

```sql
SELECT
    o.*,
    COUNT(oi.product_id) as item_count
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_number = oi.order_number
GROUP BY o.order_number
ORDER BY o.created_at DESC
LIMIT 100
```
