## 📞 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Reservations Don't Work:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify D1 database binding in wrangler.toml
3. Check API responses in Network tab
4. Verify products table has `cloudflare_image_id` column

### If Badges Don't Show:
1. Check products API returns correct status
2. Verify shop.html has badge CSS
3. Check product.status === 'reserved' in console
4. Clear browser cache and reload

### If Admin Page Errors:
1. Verify `/api/admin/reservations` returns data
2. Check CORS headers allow admin domain
3. Verify authentication if required
4. Check browser console for JS errors
