## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints Created

#### 1. GET `/api/admin/customers`
Returns all customers with aggregated data:

```javascript
{
  "success": true,
  "customers": [
    {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "phone": "+353 123 456",
      "contact": "john@example.com",
      "order_count": 5,
      "completed_orders": 3,
      "total_spent": 125.50,
      "offer_count": 7,
      "accepted_offers": 2,
      "pending_offers": 2,
      "highest_offer": 85.00,
      "last_activity": "2025-10-05T10:30:00",
      "first_activity": "2025-09-01T14:20:00",
      "last_order_date": "2025-10-05T10:30:00",
      "last_offer_date": "2025-10-04T16:45:00"
    }
  ],
  "total": 25,
  "stats": {
    "total_customers": 25,
    "customers_with_orders": 18,
    "customers_with_offers": 15,
    "total_orders": 87,
    "total_offers": 142,
    "pending_offers": 23
  }
}
```

**How it works:**
1. Queries `orders` table grouped by customer contact
2. Queries `customer_offers` table grouped by customer contact
3. Merges results by matching email/phone
4. Calculates totals and statistics
5. Sorts by last activity (order OR offer, whichever is newer)

#### 2. GET `/api/admin/customers/[contact]`
Returns complete history for one customer:

```javascript
{
  "success": true,
  "customer": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "phone": "+353 123 456",
    "contact": "john@example.com"
  },
  "orders": [
    {
      "id": 123,
      "order_id": "ORD-20251005-ABC123",
      "order_status": "completed",
      "total_amount": 45.00,
      "items": [
        {
          "category": "BN-CLOTHES",
          "size": "M",
          "image": "https://..."
        }
      ],
      "created_at": "2025-10-05T10:30:00",
      "collection_notes": "Pick up Saturday"
    }
  ],
  "offers": [
    {
      "id": 456,
      "offer_id": "OFFER-20251004-XYZ789",
      "product_id": "product-123",
      "product_category": "PO-SHOES",
      "product_size": "UK 9",
      "product_image": "https://...",
      "offer_amount": 45.00,
      "status": "pending",
      "counter_offer_amount": null,
      "admin_notes": null,
      "created_at": "2025-10-04T16:45:00",
      "responded_at": null
    }
  ],
  "stats": {
    "total_orders": 5,
    "completed_orders": 3,
    "pending_orders": 2,
    "total_spent": 125.50,
    "total_items_ordered": 12,
    "total_offers": 7,
    "pending_offers": 2,
    "accepted_offers": 3,
    "rejected_offers": 1,
    "countered_offers": 1,
    "highest_offer": 85.00,
    "average_offer": 52.14,
    "first_activity": "2025-09-01T14:20:00",
    "last_activity": "2025-10-05T10:30:00"
  }
}
```

**How it works:**
1. Gets customer name from most recent order or offer
2. Fetches ALL orders for this email/phone
3. Fetches ALL offers for this email/phone
4. Parses order items from JSON
5. Calculates comprehensive statistics
6. Returns everything sorted by date

### Data Merging Logic

**Customers are identified by:**
- Email address (if provided)
- Phone number (if provided)
- Either one can be used as unique identifier

**Merging Rules:**
1. If customer has BOTH orders and offers → Merge into one record
2. If customer has ONLY orders → Create record from orders
3. If customer has ONLY offers → Create record from offers
4. Last activity = Most recent date from either orders OR offers
5. First activity = Oldest date from either orders OR offers

### Files Created

1. **functions/api/admin/customers/index.js** - List all customers API
2. **functions/api/admin/customers/[contact].js** - Customer detail API
3. **public/admin/customers/index.html** - Customers list page
4. **public/admin/customers/detail.html** - Customer detail page

### Files Modified

1. **public/admin/index.html** - Changed nav from "Orders" to "Customers"
