    customer_name: r.customer_name,
    customer_phone: r.customer_phone,
    customer_email: r.customer_email || 'N/A',
    status: 'pending' | 'completed' | 'cancelled',
    total_amount: r.price || 0,
    created_at: r.reserved_at,
    items: [...],
    type: 'reservation',
    reservation_id: r.id,
