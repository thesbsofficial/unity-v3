└────────────────────────────────┘
```

**For Products without Price:**
```
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Reserve]      [💰 Offer]    │
└────────────────────────────────┘
```

**For Reserved Products:**
```
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│        [Reserved]              │
└────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. Highest Offer Display

```

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### New API Endpoint

**GET /api/offers/highest**

Returns highest offers for all products:

```javascript
{
  "success": true,
  "offers": {
    "product-123": {
      "highest_offer": 45.00,
      "offer_count": 3
    },
    "product-456": {
      "highest_offer": 120.00,
      "offer_count": 7
    }
  }
}
```

**Query Used:**
```sql
SELECT 
  product_id,
  MAX(offer_amount) as highest_offer,
  COUNT(*) as offer_count
FROM customer_offers
WHERE status IN ('pending', 'countered')
GROUP BY product_id
```

### Frontend Changes

**public/shop.html:**

1. **Global State** (line ~1438)
   ```javascript
   let highestOffers = {}; // Store offers by product_id
   ```

2. **Load Products** (line ~1461)
   ```javascript
   // Load products and offers in parallel
   const [productsResponse, offersResponse] = await Promise.all([
     fetch('/api/products'),
     fetch('/api/offers/highest')
   ]);
   ```

3. **Product Cards** (line ~1622)
   ```javascript
   // Get offer data from global state
   const offerData = highestOffers[product.id];
   const highestOffer = offerData?.highest_offer;
   const offerCount = offerData?.offer_count;
   ```

4. **Dual Button Layout** (line ~1640)
   ```html
   <div class="product-actions" style="display: flex; gap: 0.5rem;">
     <button class="add-to-cart">Add to Basket</button>
     <button class="make-offer-btn">💰 Offer</button>
   </div>
   ```

5. **Offer Badge** (line ~1638)
   ```html
   ${highestOffer ? 
     `<span class="highest-offer-pill">
       🔥 ${offerCount} Offer${offerCount > 1 ? 's' : ''}: €${highestOffer.toFixed(2)}
     </span>` 
   : ''}
   ```

### CSS Styling

**Flexbox Layout:**
```css
.product-actions {
  display: flex;
  gap: 0.5rem;
}

.add-to-cart {
  flex: 1; /* Takes available space */
}

.make-offer-btn {
  flex: 0 0 auto; /* Fixed width */
  background: linear-gradient(45deg, #4CAF50, #66BB6A);
}
```

**Animated Offer Badge:**
```css
.highest-offer-pill {
  background: linear-gradient(45deg, #FF6B6B, #FF8E53);
  animation: pulse 2s infinite;
}

@keyframes pulse {
  0%, 100% { transform: scale(1); }
  50% { transform: scale(1.05); }
}
```
