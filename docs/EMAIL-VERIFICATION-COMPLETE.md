## 🔧 HOW IT WORKS

### Registration Flow

1. User signs up with email
2. Account created with `email_verified = 0`
3. Verification email sent automatically
4. User receives branded email with verification link
5. User clicks link → redirected to `/verify-email.html?token=xxx`
6. Page auto-verifies → `email_verified` set to 1
7. User can now log in

### Login Flow

1. User tries to log in
2. System checks `email_verified` status
3. If `email_verified = 0`:
   - Login blocked
   - Error shown: "Please verify your email..."
   - "Resend Verification Email" button appears
4. If `email_verified = 1`:
   - Login proceeds normally

### Resend Flow

1. User clicks "Resend Verification Email" on login page
2. New token generated
3. New email sent
4. User checks inbox
5. Clicks new link → verified
