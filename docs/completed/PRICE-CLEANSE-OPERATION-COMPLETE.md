## 🎯 BUSINESS MODEL ALIGNMENT

### ✅ What SBS Unity V3 Now Does:
- Collects detailed seller information (brand, category, size, condition, defects)
- Captures high-quality product photos
- Gathers complete seller contact details (address, phone, email, social handles)
- Generates structured WhatsApp messages for seller communication
- Manages inventory via admin panel WITHOUT price display/editing

### ❌ What It Does NOT Do Anymore:
- ~~Display product prices~~
- ~~Collect asking prices from sellers~~
- ~~Calculate order totals~~
- ~~Show price estimates~~
- ~~Reference pricing in any UI text~~

### 🎉 Why This Works:
SBS can now receive comprehensive seller submissions and negotiate pricing directly via WhatsApp or phone on a case-by-case basis. The system facilitates detailed information collection without committing to any price structure, allowing maximum pricing flexibility.

## 🔍 ABOUT REMAINING "PRICE" MATCHES

If you grep the codebase for "price", you'll find matches in:

### Backup/Archive Files (Intentionally Preserved):
- `sell-backup-eligibility-gate.html` - Old form version
- `WORKING-VERSION/**/*.html` - Development backups
- `PRODUCTION-READY-BACKUP-*/` - Full system snapshots

**These are historical archives and do NOT affect the active system.**
