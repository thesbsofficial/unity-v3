# 🚨 URGENT: Remove Cloudflare Admin Redirect

**Problem:** `/admin/` is redirecting to `/admin-panel` (old page with password gate)  
**Cause:** Cloudflare Access or Transform Rule still active  
**Solution:** Disable the redirect in Cloudflare Dashboard

---

## 🔧 Fix in Cloudflare Dashboard:

### **Option 1: Check Cloudflare Access (Most Likely)**

1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Select your site: **thesbsofficial.com**
3. Click **Zero Trust** (left sidebar)
4. Click **Access** → **Applications**
5. Look for rules protecting `/admin` or `/admin-panel`
6. **Delete or disable** any rules for `/admin` or `/admin-panel`

### **Option 2: Check Transform Rules**

1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Select your site: **thesbsofficial.com**
3. Click **Rules** (left sidebar)
4. Click **Transform Rules** → **URL Redirects**
5. Look for any redirect: `/admin` → `/admin-panel`
6. **Delete** the redirect rule

### **Option 3: Check Page Rules (Legacy)**

1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Select your site: **thesbsofficial.com**
3. Click **Rules** → **Page Rules**
4. Look for any rule affecting `/admin/*`
5. **Delete** the rule

## 🧪 Test After Fixing:

1. **Clear browser cache completely**:
   - Chrome: Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data → Cached images and files
   - Or just use **Incognito/Private window**

2. Go to: https://thesbsofficial.com/admin/
3. Should see **404** (because index.html hasn't cached yet)
4. Wait 2 minutes, refresh
5. Should see **NEW admin overview** (dark theme, stats grid)

---

## 📋 What Should Happen:

```
Before (WRONG):
https://thesbsofficial.com/admin/ 
  → Redirects to /admin-panel 
  → Shows password gate ❌

After (CORRECT):
https://thesbsofficial.com/admin/
  → Loads /admin/index.html
  → Shows new overview dashboard ✅
```

## 🔍 How to Find the Rule:

The redirect is happening **before** the page even loads, which means it's a Cloudflare rule, not code.

**Most likely location:**
- **Zero Trust → Access → Applications** (90% chance it's here)
- Look for application: "Admin Panel" or "Unity v3 Admin"
- Policy will have path: `/admin-panel` or `/admin/*`

**Delete the entire Access Application** - we don't need it anymore because:
- New admin uses **session-based auth** (no Cloudflare Access needed)
- Session check happens in JavaScript
- No password gate required

---

## 🚀 Quick PowerShell Check:

Run this to see what the server is actually returning:

```powershell
# Check what's being served
curl -I https://thesbsofficial.com/admin/

# Should return:
# HTTP/2 200 (if index.html exists)
# or HTTP/2 404 (if cached old structure)
# NOT HTTP/2 301 or 302 (redirect)
```

If you see **301 or 302**, that's the Cloudflare redirect in action.

## 📞 If You Can't Find It:

Send me a screenshot of:
1. Zero Trust → Access → Applications page
2. Rules → Transform Rules page
3. And I'll tell you exactly which one to delete

---

**Bottom line:** The file `/admin-panel.html` is gone from the codebase, but Cloudflare is still redirecting to it. We need to remove that rule in your Cloudflare dashboard.
