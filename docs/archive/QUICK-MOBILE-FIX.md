## 🧭 NAVIGATION LOGIC IMPROVED

### Index Page Updated
**Before:** Home, Sell | Login  
**After:** Shop, Sell | Login

**Why?** From homepage, users want to access main features (Shop/Sell), not return home.

### Navigation Flow
```
HOME → Shop, Sell
SHOP → Home, Sell  
SELL → Home, Shop
LOGIN → Home, Sell | Shop, Register
REGISTER → Home, Sell | Shop, Login
```

**Every page lets you:**
- ✅ Get to Home
- ✅ Get to Shop
- ✅ Get to Sell  
- ✅ See Auth options
- ✅ Access Basket

**No dead ends. Always a way forward.**
