# Archived Documentation

This directory contains completed implementation logs, bug fixes, and historical audit reports. These docs are frozen snapshots of work that's already deployed.

## Purpose

Archive docs serve as a paper trail for:

- Understanding why certain decisions were made
- Tracking bug resolution history
- Referencing past migration patterns
- Onboarding new contributors to the project's evolution

## Contents Overview

All markdown files here represent **completed** work:

- Bug fixes (BASKET-CLIPPING-FIX, MOBILE-NAV-FIX, etc.)
- Feature implementations (ACCOUNT-LINKING-COMPLETE, ELIGIBILITY-GATE-SYSTEM)
- System audits (BUG-AUDIT-REPORT, ORPHANED-CODE-AUDIT)
- Deployment logs (DEPLOYMENT-SUMMARY-OCT1)
- Database migrations (DB-STANDARDIZATION-FINAL, MIGRATION-COMPLETE)
- UI overhauls (ICON-SYSTEM-V2-DEPLOYED, REBRANDING-COMPLETE)

## Maintenance

When new features are fully deployed and documented, move their docs here from `active/` to keep the working directory clean.
