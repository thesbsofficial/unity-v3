# 📱 MOBILE NAVIGATION FIX - October 1, 2025

## 🔴 CRITICAL BUG FIXED: Basket Button Cropped on Mobile

### Issue
The basket button was being cropped/cut off on mobile views across multiple pages because mobile-specific CSS was missing.

2. ✅ **login.html** - Replaced old mobile navigation CSS with correct responsive styles
3. ✅ **register.html** - Added mobile cart-toggle responsive CSS
4. ✅ **sell.html** - Added mobile cart-toggle responsive CSS
5. ✅ **shop.html** - Already had correct mobile styles (reference page)

- **Right:** Login, Basket

#### **Sell Page**
- **Left:** Home, Shop

- **Rationale:** Easy path to registration, access to shopping

#### **Register Page**

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Why `white-space: nowrap`?
Prevents "Basket" text from wrapping to two lines on small screens, which would break the button layout.

### Why Three Breakpoints?
- **Desktop (>768px):** Full-size navigation
- **Tablet (768px):** Slightly reduced for space
- **Mobile (480px):** Minimum comfortable size

### Font Size Progression
- **Desktop:** 0.9rem (14.4px)
- **Tablet:** 0.7rem (11.2px)
- **Mobile:** 0.65rem (10.4px)

Maintains readability while maximizing space efficiency.
