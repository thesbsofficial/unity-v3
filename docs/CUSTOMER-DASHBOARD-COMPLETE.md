# 🎯 CUSTOMER DASHBOARD & AUTH STATE - COMPLETE

**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## 🚀 WHAT WAS BUILT

### 1. Customer Dashboard (`/dashboard.html`)

**Full-featured customer account page with:**

- ✅ Profile section with avatar & user info
- ✅ My Orders section (empty state with shop link)
- ✅ My Sell Submissions section (empty state with sell link)
- ✅ Account settings view
- ✅ **GDPR-compliant data controls:**
  - Download my data (exports JSON)
  - Delete account (soft delete with confirmation)

### 2. Auth State Management (`/js/auth-state.js`)

**Global authentication utility that:**

- ✅ Checks if user is logged in on every page
- ✅ Auto-updates navigation (shows Dashboard + Sign Out OR Login + Register)
- ✅ Shows user's first name in nav when logged in
- ✅ Handles sign out across all pages
- ✅ Session expiry check (24 hours)
- ✅ Multi-tab sync (storage events)
- ✅ Auto-redirects logged-in users from login/register pages

### 3. Backend API Endpoints (GDPR Compliant)

**New endpoints added to `/functions/api/[[path]].js`:**

- ✅ `GET /api/users/me` - Get current user profile
- ✅ `GET /api/users/me/orders` - Get user's orders
- ✅ `GET /api/users/me/sell-cases` - Get user's sell submissions
- ✅ `DELETE /api/users/delete` - Delete account (GDPR: Right to Erasure)
  - **Soft delete:** Marks inactive, anonymizes data
  - Preserves order/case history for legal compliance
  - Clears all sessions
  - Anonymizes: email, phone, address, social_handle

### 4. Login Flow Updates

**Changes to `/public/login.html`:**

- ✅ Now redirects to `/dashboard.html` instead of `/shop.html`
- ✅ Saves login time for session expiry tracking
- ✅ Auto-redirects if already logged in

**Changes to `/public/register.html`:**

- ✅ Auto-redirects if already logged in

### 5. Navigation Updates

**Pages with auth-state integration:**

- ✅ `/public/index.html` - Home page
- ✅ `/public/shop.html` - Shop page
- ✅ `/public/sell.html` - Sell page
- ✅ `/public/login.html` - Login page (redirects if logged in)
- ✅ `/public/register.html` - Register page (redirects if logged in)

  Orders/cases → kept but anonymized
  ```

### Data Minimization (✅)

## 🎨 UI/UX FEATURES

### Dashboard Design

- **Dark theme** matching site aesthetic
- **Gold accents** for brand consistency
- **Sidebar navigation** with profile
- **Card-based layout** for orders/submissions
- **Empty states** with CTAs
- **Responsive design** for mobile

### Navigation Updates

- **Logged out:** Shows "Sign In" + "Sign Up" button
- **Seamless:** Updates instantly on all pages

---

## 📋 HOW IT WORKS

### User Flow: First Time

1. User registers → redirected to `/dashboard.html`
2. Dashboard shows empty states for orders & submissions
3. Navigation shows "👤 [Name]" + "Sign Out"

### User Flow: Returning

1. User visits any page
2. `/js/auth-state.js` checks `sessionStorage`
3. If logged in → Nav shows dashboard link
4. If not logged in → Nav shows login/register

### User Flow: Sign Out

1. User clicks "Sign Out" button
2. `sessionStorage` cleared
3. Redirected to `/login.html`
4. Navigation reverts to login/register

### User Flow: Delete Account

1. User goes to Settings in dashboard
2. Clicks "🗑️ Delete Account"
3. Modal asks to type "DELETE"
4. Confirms → API soft deletes account
5. Data anonymized, sessions cleared
6. Redirected to home page

## 🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Session Storage Keys

```javascript
sbs_user; // User profile JSON
sbs_csrf_token; // CSRF token
sbs_login_time; // Timestamp for expiry check
```

### Session Expiry

- **Duration:** 24 hours
- **Check:** On page load via `auth-state.js`
- **Action:** Auto sign-out if expired

### Database Schema (Soft Delete)

```sql
UPDATE users SET
  is_active = 0,
  email = NULL,
  phone = NULL,
  address = NULL,
  social_handle = CONCAT('deleted_', id, '_', social_handle)
WHERE id = ?
```

## 🐛 BUG FIXES

### Issue: "Site forgets you're signed in"

**Root Cause:** No auth state management across pages

**Solution:**

- Created `/js/auth-state.js` global utility
- Checks session on every page load
- Updates navigation dynamically
- Listens for storage events (multi-tab sync)

### Issue: "No dashboard after login"

**Root Cause:** Customer dashboard didn't exist

**Solution:**

- Built `/dashboard.html` with full features
- Updated login redirect: `/shop.html` → `/dashboard.html`
- Created API endpoints for user data

### Issue: "No sign out button"

**Root Cause:** No sign out UI/logic

**Solution:**

- Sign out button in nav (when logged in)
- Sign out button in dashboard
- Clears session + redirects
