## 🎯 WHAT'S LIVE NOW

### ✅ Active in Production:

1. **67 performance indexes** - Making all queries faster
2. **Foreign key enforcement** - Preventing bad data
3. **stock_moves table** - Ready for audit trail
4. **analytics_daily table** - Ready for aggregations
5. **Optimized query plans** - Using indexes efficiently

### 🔄 Still Using (Unchanged):

- `/api/reservations/create` - 24-hour reservations
- `checkout.html` - Existing checkout flow
- Status-based inventory (no quantity tracking yet)
- All existing features work exactly the same

---

## 🌐 WEBSITE STATUS

**Live URL:** https://7342b227.unity-v3.pages.dev

**Test Checklist:**
- [ ] Browse shop page (should load faster)
- [ ] Filter products by size (should be instant)
- [ ] Add items to cart (works same as before)
- [ ] Complete checkout (creates reservations as before)
- [ ] Check admin panel (should load faster)

## 📈 MONITORING DASHBOARD

### Cloudflare Analytics
**URL:** https://dash.cloudflare.com → Workers & Pages → unity-v3

**Key Metrics to Watch:**
- ✅ Response times (should be lower)
- ✅ Success rate (should stay 100%)
- ✅ Error rate (should stay 0%)
- ✅ Request volume (monitor for spikes)

---

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Optional):
1. **Test live site** - Browse, add to cart, checkout
2. **Monitor for 1 hour** - Watch Cloudflare dashboard
3. **Check analytics** - Verify events being tracked

### Future (Phase 2):
1. **Implement atomic checkout** - Use CHECKOUT-TRANSACTION-TEMPLATE.js
2. **Add quantity tracking** - Migrate to quantity-based inventory
3. **Stock movement logging** - Use stock_moves table
4. **Daily analytics** - Use analytics_daily for dashboards
