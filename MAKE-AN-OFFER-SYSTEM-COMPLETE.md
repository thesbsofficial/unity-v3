## 💡 BUSINESS TIPS

### When to Use "Make an Offer":
- ✅ Pre-owned items with variable condition
- ✅ Items you're unsure about pricing
- ✅ Rare/unique pieces
- ✅ Items you want to negotiate on
- ✅ Testing market demand

### When to Set Fixed Price:
- ✅ Brand new items
- ✅ Popular sizes (UK 9, M, L)
- ✅ Items you know the market value
- ✅ Fast-moving inventory
- ✅ Preventing underbidding

### Hybrid Strategy (Recommended):
- Set prices for 60% of inventory (fast movers)
- Leave 40% as "Make an Offer" (slow movers, unique items)
- Accept offers 10-20% below market value
- Use offers to gauge pricing for similar items
