Go to: **https://github.com/new**

Fill in:

- **Repository name:** `sbs-unity-v3`

- ⚠️ **DON'T** check "Initialize with README" (we already have one)

### 2. Connect Your Local Repository

After GitHub creates the repo, run these commands in PowerShell:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\fredb\Desktop\unity-v3\public (4)"

# Add GitHub as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/fredbademosi/sbs-unity-v3.git
