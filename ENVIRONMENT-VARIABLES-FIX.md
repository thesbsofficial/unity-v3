# 🔧 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES ISSUE - SOLUTION

**Date**: October 3, 2025  
**Issue**: CF Images credentials not accessible  
**Root Cause**: Deploying to `main` branch while Cloudflare treated `production` as the production branch (secrets unavailable)

---

## 🔍 THE PROBLEM

### Current Configuration (UPDATED):

- **Production Branch**: `main`
- **Deploying To**: `main`
- **Secrets Location**: Production environment (main)

### What's Happening:

Your secrets (CLOUDFLARE_IMAGES_API_TOKEN, CLOUDFLARE_IMAGES_HASH) live in the **Production** environment. Cloudflare Pages only makes those secrets available to the branch configured as **Production** (now `main`).

---

## ✅ SOLUTION OPTIONS

### Confirm Production Branch = `main`

### Optional: Add secrets to Preview environment (only if you re-enable it)

**Steps**:

```bash
# Open Cloudflare Dashboard
# Navigate: Workers & Pages > unity-v3 > Settings > General
# Confirm the Production branch shows `main`
```

**Result**: Deployments triggered from `main` (including wrangler deploys with `--branch main`) have access to production secrets.

**Steps**:

1. In Cloudflare Dashboard
2. **Variables and Secrets** page
3. Click **Add variable** button
4. When adding each secret, select **"Preview"** environment too
5. Add:
   - CLOUDFLARE_IMAGES_API_TOKEN
   - CLOUDFLARE_IMAGES_HASH

**Result**: Both production and preview environments will have secrets.

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED APPROACH

**Stick with `main` as the production branch.**

- ✅ `deploy-production.ps1` now targets `main`
- ✅ Secrets are read from the production environment automatically
- ✅ Preview deploys use the `preview` alias and stay isolated

---

## 📝 AFTER FIXING

With production already set to `main`:

1. **Redeploy** (or it may auto-redeploy):

```bash
wrangler pages deploy public --branch main
```

2. **Test Products API**:

```bash
curl https://main.unity-v3.pages.dev/api/products
```

3. **Expected Result**:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "products": [...], // Array of products!
  "total": 60,
  "source": "Cloudflare Images"
}
```

4. **Run Diagnostic**:
   https://main.unity-v3.pages.dev/diagnostic.html (or custom domain)

Should now pass CF Images tests! ✅

## 🔐 YOUR ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

All properly configured:

- ✅ CLOUDFLARE_IMAGES_API_TOKEN (encrypted)
- ✅ CLOUDFLARE_IMAGES_HASH (encrypted)
- ✅ CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID (plaintext)
- ✅ RESEND_API_KEY (encrypted)
- ✅ All other secrets

**They just need to be accessible to your deployment!**

---

## 🚀 QUICK FIX STEPS

1. **Go to**: https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. **Navigate**: Workers & Pages > unity-v3 > Settings > General
3. **Find**: Production branch
4. **Change**: `production` → `main`
5. **Save**
6. **Wait**: 30 seconds for redeployment
7. **Test**: https://main.unity-v3.pages.dev/api/products

Done! 🎉

---

## 📊 IMPACT

- Products API: Returns 60+ products (once secrets are populated)
- CF Images: Working
- Diagnostics: Green across the board

---

**Next Step**: Keep deploying from `main` and ensure secrets exist in the Production environment.
