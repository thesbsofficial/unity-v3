# üîê SBS ACCOUNT - FIRST LOGIN PASSWORD SETUP

**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Feature:** First-time login password setup for SBS account  
**Status:** ‚úÖ DEPLOYED

---

## **What This Does**

The **first person** who logs in with username `SBS` can set **any password they want**, and that password will be saved permanently.

### **How It Works:**

1. **First Login Check:** System detects if `SBS` account has `last_login = NULL` (never logged in before)
2. **Password Setup:** Whatever password you enter on first login becomes the new password
3. **One-Time Only:** After first successful login, normal password verification applies forever

---

## **Usage Instructions**

### **Step 1: Go to Login Page**
- Navigate to: https://e19051af.unity-v3.pages.dev/login
- Or: https://main.unity-v3.pages.dev/login

### **Step 2: Enter Credentials**
- **Username:** `SBS`
- **Password:** `[ANY PASSWORD YOU WANT]`

### **Step 3: Submit**
- Click "Sign In"
- System will:
  - Hash your password with SHA-256
  - Save it to the database
  - Log you in immediately
  - Set `last_login` timestamp

### **Step 4: Remember Your Password!**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** The password you set on first login is PERMANENT
- Write it down somewhere safe
- After first login, you MUST use this password every time

---

## **Security Features**

‚úÖ **One-Time Setup Only** - Only works if `last_login` is NULL  
‚úÖ **SBS Account Only** - This special mode only applies to username `SBS`  
‚úÖ **SHA-256 Hashing** - Password is hashed before storage  
‚úÖ **Normal Security After** - After first login, standard password verification applies  
‚úÖ **No Email Verification Required** - SBS account bypasses email verification

---

## **Technical Implementation**

```javascript
// üéØ SPECIAL SETUP MODE FOR SBS ACCOUNT - FIRST LOGIN SETS PASSWORD
if (user.social_handle === 'SBS' && user.last_login === null) {
  // First login for SBS - set whatever password they provide
  const hashedPassword = await hashPassword(password);
  await env.DB.prepare("UPDATE users SET password_hash = ? WHERE id = ?")
    .bind(hashedPassword, user.id)
    .run();
  console.log('üîê SBS first login - password set successfully');
  // Continue with login below
} else {
  // Normal password verification for everyone else
  if (!(await verifyPassword(password, user))) {
    return json({ success: false, error: "Invalid credentials" }, 401, headers);
  }
}
```

## **Current Database State**

### **Before First Login:**
```
social_handle: SBS
password_hash: 7026bb927dfc8bc2f425f39c7cf0810e5ac5749c081b1acbde41b85d16d6b404
last_login: NULL  ‚Üê This is the trigger
email_verified: 1
role: admin
```

### **After First Login:**
```
social_handle: SBS
password_hash: [NEW HASH BASED ON YOUR PASSWORD]
last_login: 2025-10-03 XX:XX:XX  ‚Üê Timestamp set
email_verified: 1
role: admin
```

---

## **What Happened to Old Password?**

The old password hash (`7026bb927dfc...` which was `IAMADMIN`) will be **replaced** with whatever password you set on first login.

---

## **Files Modified**

### `functions/api/[[path]].js`
- Added special first-login detection for SBS account
- Password setup logic before normal verification
- Logs "üîê SBS first login - password set successfully"

---

## **Deployment**

2. ‚úÖ Enter username: `SBS`
3. ‚úÖ Enter any password (e.g., `MyNewPassword123!`)
4. ‚úÖ Click "Sign In"

6. ‚úÖ Try logging out and back in with same password - should work
7. ‚úÖ Try wrong password - should fail
