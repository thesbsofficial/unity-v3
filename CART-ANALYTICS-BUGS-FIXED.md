# 🐛 CRITICAL BUGS FIXED - Cart & Analytics

**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED AND DEPLOYED

---

## 🚨 ISSUE #1: Checkout Says "Cart is Empty"

### Problem:

- User clicks "Checkout" button
- Error message: "Your basket is empty"
- Even when items are in the cart

### Root Cause:

**Storage Key Mismatch:**

```javascript
// Cart stores items as:
localStorage.setItem("sbs-basket", JSON.stringify(basket));

// Checkout reads from WRONG key:
const cart = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("cart") || "[]"); // ❌
```

### Solution:

```javascript
// Fixed to use correct key:
const cart = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("sbs-basket") || "[]"); // ✅
```

### File Changed:

- `public/shop.html` line 1511

### Status:

✅ **FIXED** - Commit: e0677f3

## 🚨 ISSUE #2: Analytics 500 Errors

### Problem:

```
POST https://thesbsofficial.com/api/analytics/track 500 (Internal Server Error)
❌ Analytics flush failed: Error: HTTP 500
```

### Root Cause:

**Production was still using OLD version of track.js:**

- We fixed the API yesterday (removed non-existent columns)
- Local version was correct
- Production was serving cached/old version

### Solution:

**Fresh deployment without cache:**

```bash
npx wrangler pages deploy public --project-name=unity-v3 --branch=MAIN
```

### Why It Happened:

- Cloudflare Pages caches Functions by default
- Previous deployment with `--commit-dirty` flag might have caused caching issue
- Fresh deployment cleared the cache

### Status:

✅ **FIXED** - Deployment: https://a3c611f2.unity-v3.pages.dev

---

## ✅ VERIFICATION STEPS

### Test Cart & Checkout:

1. ✅ Go to https://thesbsofficial.com/shop
2. ✅ Add items to basket
3. ✅ Click basket icon (should show items)
4. ✅ Click "Checkout" button
5. ✅ Should open checkout modal (not "cart is empty" error)
6. ✅ Should show all items in order summary

### Test Analytics:

1. ✅ Open browser console
2. ✅ Navigate to shop page
3. ✅ Should see: "✅ Analytics initialized"
4. ✅ Add item to cart
5. ✅ Should NOT see any 500 errors
6. ✅ Should see: "📊 Tracked: add_to_cart"

## 🎯 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Why Did This Happen?

**Cart Bug:**

- Copy-paste error when building checkout system
- Used generic 'cart' key instead of existing 'sbs-basket' key
- No cross-reference check between functions

**Analytics Bug:**

- Cloudflare Pages function caching
- Yesterday's fix deployed but cache not cleared
- Production served old broken version

### Prevention:

1. **Use constants for storage keys:**

   ```javascript
   const STORAGE_KEYS = {
     BASKET: "sbs-basket",
     SESSION: "sbs_session",
     ADMIN_SESSION: "sbs_admin_session",
   };
   ```

2. **Always verify production after deployment:**

   - Check console for errors
   - Test critical user flows
   - Verify API responses

3. **Force cache clear on critical API changes:**
   - Use `wrangler pages deployment create` instead of deploy
   - Or manually purge cache via Cloudflare dashboard

## 📝 LESSONS LEARNED

### Good Practices:

✅ Console logging helped identify exact error  
✅ Git commit messages clearly stated the fix  
✅ Separate deployments for each fix  
✅ Comprehensive documentation

### Improvements Needed:

⚠️ Need automated testing for cart/checkout flow  
⚠️ Need production smoke tests after deployment  
⚠️ Need storage key constants (not string literals)  
⚠️ Need cache-busting strategy for API updates
