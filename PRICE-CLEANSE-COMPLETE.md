## üéØ BUSINESS MODEL ALIGNMENT

The system now operates WITHOUT any price functionality:

### ‚úÖ What We Collect
- Full item details (brand, category, size, condition)
- Defect descriptions
- High-quality photos
- Seller contact info (address, phone, email, social handles)

### ‚ùå What We DON'T Collect
- ~~Asking prices~~
- ~~Price estimates~~
- ~~Order totals~~
- ~~Price negotiations~~

**Why This Works:**  
SBS can now receive detailed seller submissions and negotiate pricing case-by-case via WhatsApp/direct contact. The system facilitates information collection without committing to any price structures upfront.
