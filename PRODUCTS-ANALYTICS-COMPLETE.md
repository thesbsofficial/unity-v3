4. POST /api/analytics/track
5. Stored in analytics_events table
6. Aggregated by sync job
7. Displayed in /admin/analytics
```

```bash
# List products
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://thesbsofficial.com/api/admin/products

# Create product
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"category":"BN-CLOTHES","size":"M","brand":"Nike","price":45.99}' \
  https://thesbsofficial.com/api/admin/products

curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"price":39.99,"status":"available"}' \
  https://thesbsofficial.com/api/admin/products/123

# Delete product
curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
