```

- ‚úÖ Deploys to `main` branch (production)
- ‚úÖ Updates custom domain (thesbsofficial.com)

## üìù Deployment Guide

### Quick Deploy to Production:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\fredb\Desktop\unity-v3\public (4)"
.\scripts\deploy-production.ps1
```

### Test Changes Before Production:

- Use your local tooling or staging workflow of choice.
- When you're satisfied, run `deploy-production.ps1` to publish.

## üîë Important Notes

- **Always use `deploy-production.ps1`** to update thesbsofficial.com (main branch)
- Preview/alternate deployment scripts have been removed to avoid confusion
- All API logic is in `/functions/api/[[path]].js` and auto-deploys with Pages
- The `--commit-dirty=true` flag forces upload even with uncommitted git changes

## Future Considerations

These scripts can be adapted if you decide to:

- Set up multi-region deployments
- Create additional automation as needed
