**Deployment:** October 3, 2025  
**URL:** https://e093cd42.unity-v3.pages.dev

---

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### Issue #1: Analytics Page Not Found
**Problem:** Analytics dashboard existed but wasn't accessible  
**Root Cause:** No link in admin navigation sidebar  
**Solution:** Added "📊 Analytics" link to System section

### Issue #2: Root Directory Cluttered with MDs
**Problem:** 50+ markdown files in root directory  
**Root Cause:** No organization structure  
**Solution:** Created docs organization plan + subdirectories

## 📊 Admin Navigation Updated

**Before:**
```
System
├─ 💾 Data
├─ 📊 Logs & Analytics  (generic, didn't link to new analytics)
├─ 🔒 Security

```
System
├─ 📊 Analytics  ← NEW! Links to /admin/analytics.html
├─ 💾 Data
├─ 📝 Logs  (renamed for clarity)

```
