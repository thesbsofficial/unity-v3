# 🎯 SMART UPLOAD WITH AUTO-METADATA EXTRACTION ✅

**Status**: 🟢 DEPLOYED  
**Deployment**: 11dacdd9  
**Date**: October 3, 2025

## 🚀 WHAT'S NEW

The inventory upload tool now **automatically extracts and stores metadata** from your smart filenames directly into Cloudflare Images. The shop page reads this metadata automatically!

### ✨ Auto-Extracted Fields

When you upload with smart naming, the system automatically stores:

| Field | Auto-Extracted From | Example |
|-------|---------------------|---------|
| **name** | Description or filename | "Nike Air Max 90" |
| **category** | Upload form selection | "BN-SHOES" |
| **size** | Upload form selection | "UK-9" |
| **price** | Default to 0 | "0" (admin must set) |
| **status** | Default to active | "active" |
| **stock** | Default to 1 | "1" |
| **description** | Cleaned filename | Auto-generated |
| **batch** | Batch number | "B10030403" |
| **uploadedBy** | Admin email | Your email |
| **uploadedAt** | Timestamp | "2025-10-03T04:03:00Z" |

---

## 📋 HOW IT WORKS

### 1. **Upload with Smart Naming**
```
Filename: CAT-BN-SHOES-SIZE-UK9-DATE-20251003-BATCH-B10030403-ITEM-001.jpeg
Description: Nike Air Max 90

↓ Automatically extracts ↓
```

### 2. **Metadata Stored in CF Images**
```json
{
  "name": "Nike Air Max 90",
  "category": "BN-SHOES",
  "size": "UK-9",
  "price": "0",
  "status": "active",
  "stock": "1",
  "description": "Nike Air Max 90",
  "batch": "B10030403",
  "uploadedBy": "admin@thesbsofficial.com"
}
```

### 3. **Shop Reads Metadata Automatically**
```
/api/products → Returns products with all metadata
Shop page → Displays products with correct names, sizes, categories
```

## 🎨 SMART NAME EXTRACTION

The system intelligently parses your filenames:

**Example 1: With Description**
```
Input: DESC-NIKE-AIR-MAX-CAT-BN-SHOES-SIZE-UK9-DATE-20251003...
↓
name: "Nike Air Max"
category: "BN-SHOES"
size: "UK-9"
```

**Example 2: Without Description**
```
Input: CAT-BN-CLOTHES-SIZE-M-DATE-20251003...
↓
name: "Bn Clothes M" (auto-generated from category + size)
category: "BN-CLOTHES"
size: "M"
```

**Example 3: Using Upload Form Description**
```
Upload form description: "Vintage Adidas Hoodie"
↓
name: "Vintage Adidas Hoodie" (uses your description)
```
