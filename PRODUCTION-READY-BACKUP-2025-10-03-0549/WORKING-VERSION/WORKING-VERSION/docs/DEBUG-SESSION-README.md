# SBS Media Hub - Debug Session README
## Current State Analysis - Sept 25, 2025

### 🎯 OBJECTIVE
Fix upload functionality that's failing at database creation step after successful Cloudflare upload.

### 🔍 CURRENT ISSUES IDENTIFIED
1. **API Server Syntax Error**: Switch statement has malformed blocks causing server startup failure
2. **Frontend Logic Error**: `createItemInDB` function trying to access undefined `cloudflareId` property
3. **Response Parsing Issue**: Server returns success but frontend can't parse the Cloudflare response correctly

### 📊 EVIDENCE FROM LOGS
- ✅ Cloudflare upload SUCCESS: Image ID `acd9ebb2-b259-49c9-323a-9b30411ed600`
- ❌ Database creation FAILURE: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'cloudflareId')`
- ❌ Server startup FAILURE: Multiple "Missing statement block in switch statement clause" errors

### 🔧 FILES INVOLVED
- `api-server-fixed.ps1` - API server with syntax errors
- `sbs-media-hub-FINAL.html` - Frontend with response parsing issue
- `START-API-PROXY-FIXED.bat` - Startup script

### 📝 REQUIRED ACTIONS
1. Fix PowerShell switch statement syntax in api-server-fixed.ps1
2. Fix frontend response parsing in createItemInDB function
3. Ensure proper response format from server matches frontend expectations
4. Test complete upload flow end-to-end

### 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA
- API server starts without errors
- Upload completes with both Cloudflare AND database success
- Frontend shows "1 successful, 0 failed" instead of "0 successful, 1 failed"
