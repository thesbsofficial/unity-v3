# SBS Media Hub - Development Journey & Issue Resolution

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
**Goal:** Create an admin module for managing Cloudflare Images with tag-based organization for main website integration.

**Timeline:** Multiple development sessions focusing on perfecting the formula for admin integration.

---

## ðŸš¨ Major Issues Encountered & Solutions

### 1. Upload Functionality Completely Broken
**Issue:** User reported uploads were working perfectly "3 hours earlier" but suddenly stopped working completely.

**Symptoms:**
- Silent upload failures
- No error messages
- Previously working system now broken

**Investigation Process:**
1. CORS issues suspected initially
2. Server setup problems (port conflicts)
3. API authentication verification needed

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added comprehensive logging system with visual interface
- Enhanced error categorization (CORS, auth, permissions, rate limits)
- Discovered uploads only work with JPEG files specifically
- Added JPEG-only file validation

### 2. Port Conflicts & Server Issues
**Issue:** Default port 8080 had conflicts, server startup failures.

**Symptoms:**
- Server wouldn't start
- CORS blocking API calls
- Browser security restrictions

**Solution:**
- Changed from port 8080 to port 3000
- Updated batch file with port change
- Maintained CORS-free server setup for API access

### 3. File Type Compatibility
**Issue:** Mixed file type uploads causing silent failures.

**Discovery:** User found "only works for jpeg" files.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Updated file input to accept only `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `image/jpeg`
- Added JPEG validation in file selection
- Clear visual feedback about file requirements
- Automatic filtering of non-JPEG files with user notification

### 4. UI/UX Problems
**Issue:** Upload section kept collapsing automatically after uploads.

**Solution:**
- Removed auto-hide behavior (was hiding after 3 seconds)
- Upload section now stays open for continued use
- Only progress indicator hides after completion

### 5. Image Display Format Issues
**Issue:** Images were scaling/cropping, losing important details written on photos.

**User Requirement:** All images should be 1080x1920 (9:16 portrait) Instagram/Snapchat story format.

**Solution:**
- Changed from `object-fit: cover` to `object-fit: contain`
- Updated all Cloudflare image URLs to `w=1080,h=1920`
- Adjusted CSS containers to maintain 9:16 aspect ratio
- No cropping - full photos visible including pricing details

## ðŸŽ¯ Feature Evolution

### Phase 1: Basic Upload Testing
- Started as general upload interface
- Had pricing inputs (removed later)
- Basic error handling

### Phase 2: Admin Integration Focus  
**User Clarification:** "This is not for customers - it's a test menu for admin integration"

Changes Made:
- Focused on admin workflow
- Enhanced logging for debugging
- Simplified interface for admin use

### Phase 3: Main Site Integration Planning
**User Vision:** "This will be added to my admin page for my main site"

Key Understanding:
- All pricing/sizing written on photos themselves
- Category tags feed different sections on main website
- Perfecting the "formula" for seamless integration

Changes Made:
- Removed pricing inputs (pricing on photos)
- Enhanced tag system for site section organization
- Added site section controls (Featured, Sale, New Arrivals, etc.)
