# SBS Media Hub - Cloudflare Deletion Analysis
## Current State: September 25, 2025

### üîç CURRENT DELETION HANDLING ANALYSIS

**How the system currently works:**
1. **Two Separate Databases**: 
   - Cloudflare Images (cloud storage)
   - Local Items Database (./data/items.json)

2. **Current Problem - No Sync Mechanism:**
   - If someone deletes an image from Cloudflare directly
   - Local database still has the record
   - Image URLs will show broken/404 images
   - No automatic cleanup or detection

### üö® VULNERABILITIES IDENTIFIED

1. **Orphaned Records**: Local DB keeps items after Cloudflare deletion
2. **Broken Links**: Image URLs become 404s
3. **No Detection**: System doesn't know about external deletions
4. **Manual Cleanup**: Would require manual database editing

### üìä CURRENT API ENDPOINTS

**Existing:**
- `GET /api/images` - Fetches from Cloudflare (live data)
- `GET /api/items` - Fetches from local DB (potentially stale)
- `POST /api/images` - Upload to Cloudflare
- `POST /api/items` - Create local DB record

**Missing:**
- `DELETE /api/images/:id` - Delete from Cloudflare
- `DELETE /api/items/:id` - Delete from local DB
- Sync/verification endpoint

### üîß RECOMMENDED SOLUTIONS

**Option 1: Reactive Detection (Lightweight)**
- Add image validation when loading items
- Check if image URLs return 404
- Mark items as "image missing" 
- Allow admin to clean up manually

**Option 2: Sync Verification (Medium)**
- Add `/api/sync` endpoint
- Compare Cloudflare images vs local items
- Report discrepancies
- Allow batch cleanup

**Option 3: Full Deletion API (Complete)**
- Add DELETE endpoints for both systems
- Automatic two-way deletion
- Audit logging for all deletions
- Frontend delete buttons

### üí° IMMEDIATE RECOMMENDATION

Start with **Option 1** because:
- Minimal code changes
- Protects against broken images
- Provides admin visibility
- Can upgrade to other options later

### üéØ NEXT STEPS

1. Add image validation to loadItems()
2. Add "image missing" status to items
3. Add DELETE endpoints when ready
4. Consider sync verification tool
