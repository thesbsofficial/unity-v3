2. Verify Resend API key is configured
3. Check domain verification status in Resend
4. Review Resend logs at resend.com/logs
5. Ensure DNS records are added to Cloudflare

1. Check if token expired (24 hours)
2. Verify token wasn't already used
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Try resending verification email

### "Can't login after verification"
1. Check database: `SELECT email_verified FROM users WHERE email = 'user@example.com'`
2. Should be `1` after verification
3. Clear browser cache and cookies
4. Try resending and verifying again

### "Login still blocked after verification"
1. Hard refresh login page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Check database `email_verified` column
3. Check browser console for errors
