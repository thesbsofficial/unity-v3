# ✅ FIXED: Upload Modal Errors

**Date**: October 3, 2025  
**Status**: 🟢 DEPLOYED  
**Deployment**: 641a481b

## 🐛 Errors Fixed

### Error 1: `Cannot set properties of null (setting 'onchange')`
```
inventory/:1078 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set properties of null (setting 'onchange')
at setupDropZone (inventory/:1078:32)
```

### Error 2: `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'click')`
```
inventory/:1043 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'click')
at zone.onclick (inventory/:1043:27)
```

**Root Cause**: When resetting the upload zone's innerHTML, the file input was being removed from the DOM. Then `setupDropZone()` would try to attach event handlers to elements that no longer existed.

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. **Preserve File Input in DOM**
When resetting the drop zone, now includes the file input:
```html
zone.innerHTML = `
    <div>Upload zone content...</div>
    <input type="file" id="fileInput" multiple accept="image/*" style="display: none;">
`;
```

### 2. **Added Safety Checks**
`setupDropZone()` now checks if elements exist before accessing them:
```javascript
if (!zone || !fileInput) {
    console.warn('Upload zone or file input not found');
    return;
}
```

### 3. **Fixed Event Handlers**
All event handlers now check for element existence:
```javascript
zone.onclick = (e) => {
    e.stopPropagation();
    if (fileInput) fileInput.click(); // Safety check
};
```

### 4. **Auto Re-setup After innerHTML Changes**
When zone content is replaced (file selection/drop), automatically re-attach handlers:
```javascript
zone.innerHTML = `...new content...`;
setTimeout(() => setupDropZone(), 0); // Re-attach handlers
```
