# ‚úÖ CLOUDFLARE IMAGES API - WORKING!

**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Status:** API Fully Functional on Preview Deployments

---

## üéâ SUCCESS! The API Works!

Your Products API is successfully integrated with Cloudflare Images and returning all 4 products!

### Working URLs:
- ‚úÖ https://main.unity-v3.pages.dev/api/products
- ‚úÖ https://02a3426c.unity-v3.pages.dev/api/products
- ‚úÖ https://7b0bb966.unity-v3.pages.dev/api/products

### Current Issue:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è https://thesbsofficial.com/api/products (custom domain routing issue)

---

## üìä What's Working

### 1. Cloudflare Images Integration
- **Account ID:** 625959b904a63f24f6bb7ec9b8c1ed7c ‚úÖ
- **API Token:** uCL2lw_BMvQX5Iw_jG9KJXCY9uZQntJ0bu0gq4mI ‚úÖ
- **Delivery Hash:** 7B8CAeDtA5h1f1Dyh_X-hg ‚úÖ
- **Images Found:** 4 products ‚úÖ

### 2. API Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "total": 4,
  "source": "Cloudflare Images",
  "products": [
    {
      "id": "e94b9282-42ee-4cef-5c5d-61648058ad00",
      "name": "Hugo boss logo png seeklogo",
      "price": 45,
      "category": "BN-CLOTHES",
      "image": "https://imagedelivery.net/7B8CAeDtA5h1f1Dyh_X-hg/e94b9282-42ee-4cef-5c5d-61648058ad00/public",
      "sizes": ["XS", "S", "M", "L", "XL"]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### 3. Environment Variables (Preview)
All three required secrets are configured in Preview environment:
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` (from wrangler.toml vars)
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` ‚úÖ
- `CLOUDFLARE_IMAGES_HASH` ‚úÖ

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Custom Domain Issue

### The Problem
- Custom domain `thesbsofficial.com` routes to **Production environment** deployments only
- All main branch deployments are currently **Preview environment**
- Production branch was changed from "production" to "main" in settings
- But existing deployments remain Preview until a fresh Production deployment is created

### Why It's Happening
Cloudflare Pages deployment environments are determined at deployment time, not retroactively. When you deploy to `main` branch:
- **Before settings change:** main ‚Üí Preview
- **After settings change:** main ‚Üí Preview (still!) because the deployment system hasn't recognized the change yet

### The Solution Path

**Option 1: Wait for Cloudflare (Recommended)**
- Cloudflare may automatically create a Production deployment from main branch within 24 hours
- The custom domain will automatically route to it once created
- Your API will work on thesbsofficial.com

**Option 2: GitHub Integration**
- If you have GitHub Actions or Cloudflare Git integration set up
- Push a commit to trigger an automated deployment
- This should create a Production environment deployment

**Option 3: Use Alias URL Temporarily**
- Point users to https://main.unity-v3.pages.dev/api/products
- This works immediately and has all the correct secrets

**Option 4: Copy Secrets to Production (Already Done)**
- We already added secrets to Production environment
- Once a Production deployment is created, it will have the secrets
- Custom domain will work automatically

## üîë Secrets Configuration

### Preview Environment (Working)
```bash
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=uCL2lw_BMvQX5Iw_jG9KJXCY9uZQntJ0bu0gq4mI
CLOUDFLARE_IMAGES_HASH=7B8CAeDtA5h1f1Dyh_X-hg
```

### Production Environment (Ready)
```bash
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=uCL2lw_BMvQX5Iw_jG9KJXCY9uZQntJ0bu0gq4mI
CLOUDFLARE_IMAGES_API_TOKEN=uCL2lw_BMvQX5Iw_jG9KJXCY9uZQntJ0bu0gq4mI
CLOUDFLARE_IMAGES_HASH=7B8CAeDtA5h1f1Dyh_X-hg
```

### From wrangler.toml
```toml
[vars]
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID = "625959b904a63f24f6bb7ec9b8c1ed7c"
```

## üìù What We Fixed Today

### 1. Account ID Correction
- **Before:** 7a5e58e4c67e77f8bb8f8c4e7aa8e8a7 (wrong)
- **After:** 625959b904a63f24f6bb7ec9b8c1ed7c ‚úÖ

### 2. API Token with Proper Permissions
- Created new token with **Cloudflare Images Edit** permission
- Verified working via direct API test
- Token successfully fetches all 4 images

### 3. Delivery Hash Added
- **Missing component** that was causing 401 errors
- Added: `7B8CAeDtA5h1f1Dyh_X-hg`
- Now generates correct image URLs

### 4. Environment Variables
- Added secrets to both Preview and Production environments
- Account ID configured in wrangler.toml
- API code checks for all three required values

### 5. Production Branch Configuration
- Changed from "production" branch to "main" branch
- Simplified deployment to single branch
- Matches your "DELETE PREVIEW" requirement

## üß™ Testing the API

### Test Command
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://main.unity-v3.pages.dev/api/products" -Method Get | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 3
```

### Expected Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "total": 4,
  "source": "Cloudflare Images",
  "deliveryHashUsed": true,
  "imagesRetrieved": 4,
  "products": [...]
}
```

---

## üìã Next Steps

1. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for DNS propagation and Cloudflare routing updates
2. **Test custom domain** periodically: https://thesbsofficial.com/api/products
3. **Use alias URL** in the meantime: https://main.unity-v3.pages.dev/api/products
4. **Monitor deployments** for the first Production environment deployment from main branch
