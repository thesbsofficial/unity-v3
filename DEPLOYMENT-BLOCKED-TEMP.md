# Deployment Issue - October 4, 2025

## Problem
Cloudflare Pages API returning 500 Internal Server Error during asset upload.

```
POST /pages/assets/upload -> 500 Internal Server Error
```

## What We Tried
1. ✅ Committed all changes (commit: 715a759)
2. ❌ Deploy via `wrangler pages deploy` - API 500 error
3. ❌ Deploy with `--commit-dirty=true` - Same error

## Possible Solutions

### Option 1: Wait and Retry
Cloudflare API might be experiencing temporary issues. Wait 5-10 minutes and retry.

### Option 2: Deploy via Dashboard
1. Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com/625959b904a63f24f6bb7ec9b8c1ed7c/pages/view/unity-v3
2. Click "Create deployment"
3. Upload files manually or connect to Git

### Option 3: Push to GitHub (if connected)
If Git integration is set up:
```bash
git push origin MAIN
```
Cloudflare will auto-deploy.

### Option 4: Use Direct Upload
Try uploading just the functions folder:
```bash
npx wrangler pages deploy functions --project-name=unity-v3
```

## Current Status
- ✅ Code compiled successfully
- ✅ All changes committed to git
- ✅ Local testing passing
- ❌ Production deployment blocked by API error

## Changes Ready to Deploy
- Admin health check endpoint (`/api/admin/health-check`)
- Updated [[path]].js with comprehensive health monitoring
- Documentation (DEPLOYMENT-OCT-4-2025.md, CLOUDFLARE-FEATURES-AUDIT.md)
- Config health check script

## Recommendation
**Try Option 2 (Dashboard)** or **wait 10 minutes and retry wrangler command**.

The deployment is ready and tested locally. This is just a temporary Cloudflare API issue.
