# 📘 Implementation Journal & Change Log (live)

**Last updated:** 2025-09-25 11:05 IE (Europe/Dublin)
**Scope:** Security proxy, unified API, JSON items store, uploads, smart naming (batch + sequence + markers), "by-9" loader, Help + Inspector, UI polish.
**Note:** All "deleted item" handling has been removed. No `DELETED` tags, toggles, or text appear in the UI.

---

## 0) Editor README (pin to top & KEEP)

* Match ports: the HTML's `API_CONFIG.base` must match the unified server port from the launcher.
* Never paste tokens or secrets into HTML; the server keeps them in env vars.
* After each edit: refresh → confirm header build banner → open **Help → System Inspector** → run the step's "How to test".

---

## 1) Security & Proxy — **Completed**

**[2025-09-25 09:20 IE]**

**What changed**

* Removed all client-side tokens.
* Added server proxy for Cloudflare Images at `/api/images` (POST upload, GET list).
* CORS set for local dev; CF secrets only on server (env).

**Files**

* `api-server*.ps1` (unified server; holds CF creds in env).
* `START-SBS-MEDIA-HUB.bat` (single launcher).
* `sbs-media-hub-*.html` (points to `/api` base; no tokens).

**How to test**

1. Run launcher.
2. Open site → **Help → System Inspector** shows **API Connected**.
3. Upload a small JPEG → see CF `id` + variants in logs.

**Acceptance**

* No tokens visible in browser; uploads succeed only via proxy.

---

## 2) Items API (JSON store) — **Completed (base)**

**[2025-09-25 09:40 IE]**

**What changed**

* `/api/items` JSON store with CRUD skeleton + append-only audit.
* "Load All Items" now reads Items API (single source of truth).

**Files**

* `api-server*.ps1` (routes: `GET/POST/PATCH /api/items`, `GET /api/audit`).
* `sbs-media-hub-*.html` (loader now calls Items API).

**How to test**

* Start server → click **🔄 Load All Items** → first run shows "0 items".
* Upload one JPEG → refresh → item persists from DB.

**Acceptance**

* `GET /api/items` returns `{ "success": true, "count": N, "data": [] }` (array is always an array).

---

## 3) Upload pipeline (proxy → DB) — **Completed**

**[2025-09-25 10:00 IE]**

**What changed**

* 2-step flow: (1) proxy upload to Cloudflare; (2) create item in Items API.
* Server logs each request/response with timestamp.

**Files**

* `sbs-media-hub-*.html` (`processUpload`, `uploadToCloudflare`, `createItemInDB`).
* `api-server*.ps1` (request/response logging).

**How to test**

* Choose JPEG + category + size → **Upload**.
* Check **Upload Logs** + Inspector → then **Load All Items** shows the new card.

**Acceptance**

* "1 successful, 0 failed" and item saved to DB.

---

## 4) Smart naming (batch + sequence + markers) — **Completed**

**[2025-09-25 10:05 IE]**

**What changed**

* Auto filenames with **Batch ID** and **sequential ITEM numbers** (001, 002, …).
* Marker-based, self-explaining names used as the **actual Cloudflare filename** (new `File` with custom name before POST).

**Schema (v2, markers)**

```
DESC-<Name>-CAT-<Category>-SIZE-<Size>-DATE-<YYYYMMDD>-TIME-<HHMM>-BATCH-<BMMDDHHMM>-ITEM-<###>.jpeg
```

* `DESC-` optional; others populate automatically (category/size/date/time/batch/item).

**Files**

* `sbs-media-hub-*.html` (generator, live preview, "Filename Component Guide").

**How to test**

* Upload 2–3 files with description blank → verify CF shows `CAT-… SIZE-… DATE-… BATCH-… ITEM-001/002…`.
* Add an optional description → `DESC-…` appears in CF filename.

**Acceptance**

* CF filenames match marker scheme; ITEM sequence increments within the batch.

---

## 5) "By-9" incremental loader — **Completed (v1)**

**[2025-09-25 09:55 IE]**

**What changed**

* First **9** items render on load when data exists (no extra click).
* **View More (9)** appends next 9; counter reflects remaining.

**Files**

* `sbs-media-hub-*.html` (grid loader + counters).

**How to test**

* With ≥18 items: **Load All Items** → see 9 → click **View More (9)** to append.

**Acceptance**

* Counts correct; smooth on iPhone.

---

## 6) Help + Inspector + Logs — **Completed**

**[2025-09-25 10:12 IE]**

**What changed**

* **Help** modal with short "how-to" for each feature.
* **System Inspector**: DB stats, API connection test, **localStorage viewer**, live activity log (downloadable).
* Build/progress sheet embedded for quick review.

**Files**

* `sbs-media-hub-*.html` (Help + Inspector UI & functions).

**How to test**

* **Help** → run **Test Connection** (200 OK) → open **Local Storage** → refresh/download logs.

**Acceptance**

* One place to verify state, storage, and recent actions.

---

## 7) API Contract (current)

**Images**

* `POST /api/images` → `{ success, result: { id, variants[], filename, meta } }`
* `GET /api/images` → proxied list (used by migration/diagnostics)

**Items**

* `GET /api/items` → `{ success, count, data: Item[] }`
* `POST /api/items` → `{ success, item }`
* `PATCH /api/items/:id` (tags/status/section/note) → `{ success, item }`
* `GET /api/audit` → `{ success, count, data: AuditEntry[] }`

**Notes**

* All JSON; arrays are plain arrays (not wrapped).
* Server prints timestamped logs for every request.

---

## 8) How to verify after any edit (quick)

1. Header banner shows fresh build stamp/hash.
2. **Help → Inspector**: API Connected ✓, DB test 200 ✓, logs visible.
3. **Load All Items**: 9 cards render; **View More (9)** appends correctly.
4. **Upload**: CF filename uses marker scheme; item persists in DB.

---

### Changelog (time-stamped)

* **[2025-09-25 09:20]** Proxy/no-token model wired; browser calls `/api`.
* **[2025-09-25 09:40]** Items API (JSON CRUD) live; UI reads DB.
* **[2025-09-25 09:55]** "By-9" incremental grid loader enabled.
* **[2025-09-25 10:00]** Upload 2-step flow stable; server logging on.
* **[2025-09-25 10:05]** Smart naming v2 (markers + batch + sequence) applied to actual CF filename.
* **[2025-09-25 10:12]** Help modal + System Inspector (logs, localStorage viewer, DB test).

## Ground Rules (locked)

* **Admin-only** page. No customer view here.
* **No prices** anywhere.
* **Cloudflare writes via `/api/images` proxy** (no tokens in the browser).
* **Source of truth:** `/api/items` (not localStorage).
* **iPhone-first:** 44px taps, safe-area insets, system font, high contrast.
* **Photos first:** big, uncropped thumbs; one-tap full-screen preview.

**Constants**

* **STATUS:** `available, reserved, sold, archived`
* **SECTIONS (tags):** `featured, sale, new, view-all`
* **TAGS (preset only):** `featured, sale, new, view-all, men, women, unisex, tracksuit, hoodie, tee, denim, jacket, sneaker, sandal, boot, accessory, black, white, grey, navy, red, blue, green, beige`
* **SIZES:** apparel `XS–XXL`; shoes UK `6–12` incl. halves
* **VARIANTS:** `thumb 320w`, `web 828w`, `public 1170w` (scale-down, auto format, q=85)

---

## A) Bulk System — Full Blueprint (the heart of the hub)

### 1) Selection Model (choose many, safely)

**Goal:** let users act on **everything they filtered**, not just what's on screen.

**Behavior**

* Tap card = select / deselect. Long-press = quick actions (mobile).
* **Select All (Filtered)** toggle:

  * **OFF** → *explicit* selection of individual ids.
  * **ON** → *all-filtered* selection of the current filter result set.
* Selection **persists** across filter/sort changes.
* Bulk bar shows **`Selected X of Y filtered (Z total)`**, plus **Clear**.

**State to track**

* `selectionMode`: `"explicit"` or `"allFiltered"`.
* `selectedIds` (when explicit).
* `filterSnapshot` (when allFiltered): frozen copy of current filters/search at the moment you clicked Select All, so counts don't lie.
* `excludedIds` (when allFiltered + taps on individual cards to exclude).

**Acceptance**

* Switching filters/sorts doesn't silently drop selection.
* Counts are correct for both modes (explicit/allFiltered).
* "Clear selection" always resets quickly.

---

### 2) Bulk Actions (strict, preset-only)

All actions accept **preset inputs** only (no free text):

1. **Add Tags** (multi select from allowed tags)
2. **Remove Tags** (multi)
3. **Set Status** (one of the 4 values)
4. **Move Section** (set to `featured | sale | new | view-all`)
5. **Move Album/Location** (single value; if presets exist, use them; otherwise a short text field)
6. **Append Note** (single line, appended; stamped in audit)

**Rules**

* Tags are idempotent (adding an existing tag = no change).
* Status is **exactly one** value per item.
* Sections are tags: set replaces section tag if you want mutual exclusivity.

**Acceptance**

* Inputs are from dropdowns/chips only; no free-typing new tags in bulk.

---

### 3) Bulk Bar & Action Modals (simple, readable)

**Bulk bar (sticky, iPhone-safe):**

* Left: live count `Selected X of Y filtered (Z total)`
* Right: action buttons (icons + short labels)

**Action modal (Preview → Apply):**

* **Preview view** shows:

  * Items affected: `N`
  * **Per-change summary:**

    * Tags to add/remove (counts)
    * Status `from → to` (counts)
    * Section `from → to` (counts)
    * Album/location changes (counts)
    * Notes to append (length limit ok?)
  * **Sample list (first 10)** items with their title/size for human sanity check
  * Warnings (e.g., "7 items already have tag X; will be no-ops")

* **Apply view** (after confirm):

  * Progress bar with percent and "batch m/n"
  * Live counters: **changed / skipped / errors**
  * "Export CSV" (errors/skips) button
  * Undo button appears in toast on completion

**Acceptance**

* Always get a preview before real changes.
* Apply is batched and non-blocking; UI stays responsive.

---

### 4) Preview Engine (safe dry-run)

**Input**

* If `selectionMode === "allFiltered"` → send the **filterSnapshot** (text, tags, status, section, album, date ranges).
* If `"explicit"` → send `selectedIds`.

**Server preview does**

* Resolves target ids (filter or ids).
* Computes **per-item diffs** for the requested action without writing.
* Returns:

  * `totalTargets`
  * `willChange` (count)
  * `noOps` (count)
  * `conflicts` (items that fail validation)
  * `summary` (per-field counts)
  * `sampleItems` (first 10, formatted)
  * `previewToken` (to bind subsequent Apply to this exact set)

**Acceptance**

* Preview never mutates data.
* Result matches what Apply will do (same set, via token).

---

### 5) Apply Engine (batched, resilient)

**Input**

* `previewToken` + the final action payload (unchanged) to avoid drift.

**Batching**

* **Batch size:** 200 items per write cycle.
* **Parallelism:** at most 2–3 concurrent batches (keep UI smooth; avoid rate limits).

**Conflict handling**

* Each item includes a lightweight version (e.g., `updatedAt` or `etag`).
* If version mismatch since preview → **skip** and log (do not block the run).

**Idempotency**

* Actions that do nothing (e.g., removing a tag that isn't there) become **no-ops**; count them.

**Progress & logging**

* Live numbers: `changed / skipped / errors`.
* On finish: toast + **Export CSV** (columns: `itemId, action, field, from, to, reason`).

**Acceptance**

* Large sets (500–1000) run without freezing or blocking taps/scroll.
* Errors don't kill the whole job; they're collected & exportable.

---

### 6) Undo System (last 10 ops, exact restore)

**What to store**

* **One record per operation** containing:

  * `operationId`, `timestamp`, `actor`
  * `actionType` (e.g., `addTags`, `setStatus`)
  * `targetDescriptor` (ids or filter snapshot used)
  * **Diffs array** for each changed item:

    * `{ itemId, field, before, after }` (minimal per field)
  * Totals: `changed / skipped / errors`
  * **CSV** snapshot (for audit download)

**Undo flow**

* "Undo" picks the latest op and **applies reverse diffs** in batches.
* If any item has changed since, **skip** that item and log partial undo.
* Keep only **last 10** records (rolling).

**Acceptance**

* After Undo, the changed items return to the exact **before** state.
* Partial undo is reported clearly (counts + CSV).

---

### 7) Visibility & "Know What's Going On"

* **Top status strip**: Loading…, Loaded `N`, last sync time; errors → tap to view log.
* **Bulk progress**: sticky progress bar + counts; never blocks the grid.
* **On-card feedback**: light flash or "Edited just now" for items changed by bulk (clears after a few seconds).
* **After save**: small **"Saved • hh\:mm"** indicator updates.

**Acceptance**

* At any moment, you can tell: what is selected, what will change, what just changed, and if anything failed.

---

### 8) Mobile UX guarantees

* Bulk bar and modals **respect safe-area** (iPhone home indicator).
* **44px** minimum tap zones for chips/buttons.
* **Long-press** opens quick actions; **image tap** opens full-screen viewer with pinch-to-zoom and swipe back.
* No hover-only behaviors.

**Acceptance**

* Entire bulk flow is thumb-friendly on iPhone.

---

## B) Supporting Systems that Make Bulk Work

### 9) Grid, Photos & Visibility (View More 9)

* iPhone-first card shell with lazy-loaded images, safe-area padding, and responsive 2→5 column breakpoint.
* Initial render shows **9** cards; grid footer displays `Showing X of Y filtered` counter.
* `View More (9)` button appends nine more items per tap, maintains scroll position, hides automatically when all items are visible.
* Filters/search reset the grid back to the first 9 automatically while keeping selection state accurate for full filtered set.
* Button is full-width, ≥44px tall on iPhone; desktop centers counter + button inline.

**Acceptance**

* First load shows 9 cards, counter reflects counts, button hides when X === Y, and filter/search changes reset the batch cleanly.

---

### 10) Filters & Search (drive selections)

* Chips: **New Today**, **No Photos**, **By Status**, **By Section**, **By Tag**.
* Search on: `title, size, tags, status, album`.
* **Debounce 250ms** to avoid jank.
* **Filter snapshot** is serializable so **Select All (Filtered)** stays truthful.

**Acceptance**

* Two taps isolate common worklists; search never stutters.

---

### 11) Items API (truth & audit)

* Endpoints:

  * `GET /items?text&tags&status§ion&album`
  * `POST /items` (create)
  * `PATCH /items/:id` (edit)
  * `POST /items:bulk` → `{ mode:'preview' | 'apply' }`
  * `POST /items:undo` → reverse a prior op
  * `(optional) GET /audit?itemId=...` or download per-op CSV
* Writes stamp `updatedAt`, `actor`, and record diffs.

**Acceptance**

* Bulk Preview/Apply/Undo can be fully driven from the API.

---

### 12) Upload & Photos (so you can see everything easily)

* Accept **JPG/PNG/WEBP/HEIC** → convert **JPEG/PNG/HEIC → WEBP** client-side.
* Max **10MB**, **3× retry** with backoff; per-file progress; **CSV** log.
* Card thumbs use **`thumb`** variant; full-screen uses **`web/public`**.
* Copy-URL button on card (quick sharing).

**Acceptance**

* iPhone photos "just work"; previewing full size is instant; failures are obvious.

---

## C) Implementation Order (tiny, safe steps)

1. **Clean page**: remove price & customer view; switch to system font; add safe-area; 2-column iPhone grid; embed in-app help + live checklist sheet; strip legacy test-only controls (e.g., Load Real Images/Test Upload buttons, lab notes).
2. **Proxy on**: `/api/images` live; client uploads via proxy; remove token from client.
3. **Items API**: CRUD + bulk preview/apply + undo + audit skeleton.
4. **Grid, Photos & Visibility (View More 9)**: virtualized grid shell; lazy image loading; incremental 9-card batches with counter + `View More (9)` button (full-width, ≥44px on iPhone); hide button when all loaded; reset on filter/search changes.
5. **Constants wired**: replace any free-text in admin with presets; validate on save.
6. **Selection model**: implement `selectionMode`, `filterSnapshot`, `selectedIds/excludedIds`; sticky bulk bar.
7. **Bulk actions**: Add/Remove Tags, Set Status, Move Section, Move Album, Append Note → build **Preview** modals.
8. **Apply engine**: batching, progress bar, conflict skip, CSV log.
9. **Undo(10)**: diff storage, reverse apply, partial-undo handling.
10. **Quick Add + duplicate guard**: bottom sheet on iPhone; **Save & Next** cadence.
11. **Perf/UX pass**: debounce 250ms, lazy images, full-screen viewer, "Saved • hh\:mm".

---

## D) Acceptance Gate (ship when all pass)

* No client tokens; uploads via proxy only.
* **Select-All-Filtered** edits complete dataset; counts always correct.
* Every bulk action has **Preview → Apply (batched) → Undo(10)** with progress + CSV.
* **500-item bulk ≤ 15 min**, UI stays responsive.
* **Add 10 items ≤ 2 min** on iPhone; duplicate guard works.
* Grid smooth at \~2k items; photos clear; full-screen works.
* Audit diffs recorded; PIN gates Manager actions.
* Public site reads the same Items API; sections update instantly.

---

## E) High-risk items & how we neutralize them

* **Token migration:** stand up proxy, switch client, then delete client token (in that order). Test uploads before removal.
* **Data cleaning:** migrate localStorage → Items API; map unknown tags to `view-all`; write `migrationReport.csv`.
* **Drift between Preview and Apply:** bind Apply to **previewToken** + check `updatedAt`; skip conflicts (log them).
* **Undo correctness:** store **before/after** per item/field; never compute undo from current state.

---

### Final Mantra

**One page. One grid. One bulk bar. Presets only. Preview → Apply → Undo. iPhone first. See everything clearly.**

## 🚀 ENHANCEMENT LOG - AUTOMATIC DELETION DETECTION & SMART NAMING SYSTEM

### 📅 September 25, 2025 - Advanced Image Validation & Database Comparison System

#### **🎯 COMPLETED ENHANCEMENTS:**

**1. 🔍 Advanced Database vs Cloudflare Comparison System**
- ✅ **Database-First Approach**: Maintains complete inventory records even when images are deleted from Cloudflare
- ✅ **Intelligent Deletion Detection**: Automatically compares local database against live Cloudflare images
- ✅ **Auto-Tagging System**: Automatically marks missing/deleted images with `DELETED` tag
- ✅ **Visual Status Dashboard**: Real-time counts showing Database items vs Live vs Deleted
- ✅ **Hide/Show Toggle**: Default hides deleted items for clean view, toggle to show with counts

**2. 🎨 Visual Composition Detection System**
- ✅ **Error Pattern Recognition**: Detects when images show gradient/emoji error pattern instead of actual content
- ✅ **Automatic Marking**: Auto-marks items showing error composition as `DELETED`
- ✅ **Dimension Analysis**: Validates image dimensions to detect placeholder/error images
- ✅ **Real-time Validation**: Client-side detection of failed image loads with immediate database updates
- ✅ **Multiple Detection Methods**: HEAD requests, partial content checks, composition analysis

**3. 🏷️ Self-Explaining Filename System with Key Markers**
- ✅ **Marker-Based Naming**: Uses prefixes like `DESC-`, `CAT-`, `SIZE-`, `DATE-`, `BATCH-`, `ITEM-`
- ✅ **Sequential Batch Numbering**: Timestamp-based batch IDs (MMDDHHMM) with item numbering 001, 002, 003...
- ✅ **Actual Cloudflare Filenames**: Creates new File objects with custom names for real JPEG filename changes
- ✅ **Self-Documenting**: Filenames instantly explain content without needing database lookup
- ✅ **Format Examples**: `DESC-Nike-Air-Max-CAT-BN-SHOES-SIZE-UK-9-DATE-20250925-BATCH-B09251430-ITEM-001.jpeg`

**4. 📊 Enhanced Status & Monitoring**
- ✅ **Comprehensive Dashboard**: Shows Database count, Live count, Deleted count, newly detected deletions
- ✅ **Detailed Comparison Panel**: Appears when deletions detected, explains benefits of database approach
- ✅ **Color-Coded Status**: Green for live, red for deleted, orange for newly detected
- ✅ **Toggle Button Counts**: Shows exact number of hidden/shown deleted items
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Status updates immediately when deletions are detected

#### **🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**

**Database Comparison Logic:**
```javascript
// Enhanced validation with composition detection
- HEAD request validation for basic availability
- Content-type checking for actual image data
- Partial content analysis to detect HTML/text responses
- Image load testing with dimension validation
- Client-side composition pattern detection
- Automatic database updates when deletions detected
```

**Smart Filename Generation:**
```javascript
// Self-explaining filename with key markers
DESC-{description}-CAT-{category}-SIZE-{size}-DATE-{YYYYMMDD}-BATCH-{MMDDHHMM}-ITEM-{001}.jpeg

// File object recreation for Cloudflare
const customFile = new File([file], filename, {
    type: file.type,
    lastModified: file.lastModified
});
formData.append('file', customFile, filename);
```

**Composition Detection System:**
```javascript
// Detects gradient/emoji error patterns
- Monitors for linear-gradient backgrounds
- Checks for 📸 emoji content
- Validates image dimensions
- Auto-marks as DELETED when error patterns detected
```

#### **🎯 USER BENEFITS:**

1. **Complete Inventory Control**: Never lose track of items even when deleted from Cloudflare
2. **Automatic Detection**: System automatically finds and marks deleted images
3. **Clean Default View**: Shows only live items by default for clean inventory management
4. **Instant Understanding**: Filenames are completely self-explaining with key markers
5. **Database Backup**: Full metadata preserved for easy re-uploading
6. **Real-time Monitoring**: Immediate detection and notification of deletions

#### **📈 SYSTEM PERFORMANCE:**

- **Detection Accuracy**: Multi-layer validation catches deletions via HTTP errors, content-type mismatches, and visual composition analysis
- **Database Integrity**: Maintains complete records with deletion tracking and reasons
- **User Experience**: Clean interface with smart defaults (hide deleted) and optional full view
- **Filename Clarity**: Self-explaining names eliminate confusion about item contents
- **Batch Management**: Sequential numbering with timestamp-based batch tracking

---
