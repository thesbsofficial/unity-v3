> **Purpose:** This document is the canonical source for every category, size, tag, and reserved keyword used across the SBS admin hub, upload pipeline, and public site. Update this file whenever a new term is added or retired.
>
> **Scope:** Live vocabulary as of 2025-09-27 pulled from `script.js`, dublin files, and published build plans.

## 1. Inventory Categories (Admin & Public)

| Code | Human Label | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BN-CLOTHES` | Brand New â€¢ Clothes | Upload form â†’ Category select |
| `BN-SHOES`   | Brand New â€¢ Shoes   | Upload form â†’ Category select |
| `PO-CLOTHES` | Pre-Owned â€¢ Clothes | Upload form â†’ Category select |
| `PO-SHOES`   | Pre-Owned â€¢ Shoes   | Upload form â†’ Category select |

These codes double as Cloudflare metadata, upload filename markers, and public site `data-category` attributes (mapped to `brand-new-clothes`, `brand-new-shoes`, etc.).

## 8. Maintenance Rules

1. **When adding a new tag/size/category:**
   - Update the upload form presets.
   - Update this file.
   - Add validation rule (once Phase 2 is complete).
2. **When deprecating a term:**
   - Remove it from presets.
   - Note the last date used here and plan a cleanup job.
3. **Review cadence:** Revisit this registry at the end of every major release or monthly if tags change frequently.
