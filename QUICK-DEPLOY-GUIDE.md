# Quick Deployment Guide

## Current Situation
- ✅ Code pushed to GitHub (commit 715a759)
- ❌ Direct wrangler deploy fails (4,313 files = API timeout)
- ⏳ Waiting for automatic Cloudflare Pages build from GitHub

## Best Options

### Option 1: Let Cloudflare Auto-Deploy from GitHub ⭐
Since `git push origin MAIN` succeeded, Cloudflare Pages should automatically:
1. Detect the push to MAIN branch
2. Build and deploy automatically
3. Usually takes 2-5 minutes

**Check deployment status:**
https://dash.cloudflare.com/625959b904a63f24f6bb7ec9b8c1ed7c/pages/view/unity-v3

### Option 2: Manual Dashboard Deployment
1. Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com/625959b904a63f24f6bb7ec9b8c1ed7c/pages/view/unity-v3
2. Click "Create deployment"
3. Select "Connect to Git" or "Direct Upload"
4. For Direct Upload: only upload `functions/` and essential HTML files

### Option 3: Deploy ONLY Functions (Minimal)
```bash
cd functions
npx wrangler pages functions build
# Then manually upload via dashboard
```

## What Changed (Commit 715a759)
- ✅ Admin health check endpoint at `/api/admin/health-check`
- ✅ Comprehensive configuration verification
- ✅ All Cloudflare secrets confirmed (API tokens, Images config)
- ✅ Documentation (3 new .md files)

## Test After Deployment
```bash
# Public health check
curl https://thesbsofficial.com/api/health

# Admin health check (requires auth)
curl https://thesbsofficial.com/api/admin/health-check -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## Status: ⏳ AWAITING AUTO-DEPLOYMENT
Your code is pushed to GitHub. Cloudflare should pick it up automatically within 5 minutes.
